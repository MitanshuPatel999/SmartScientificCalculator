# **Smart Scientific Calculator**
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/4P8i96DQJBA
#### Description:
Smart Scientific Calculator is a voice enabled calculator which is having simple and realistic user interface.

You can perform all basic mathematical operations like: Addition,Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, log₁₀, ln, Degree to Radian or vice-versa, Trignometric functions, Factorial, Square of a number, Cube of a number, Power, etc.

All operations can be accessed using buttons(by clicking them) or by voice command clicking microphone button.

This project is mostly based on Tkinter library & SpeechRecognition library providing GUI and Voice interactions respectively to the calculator. Both come with very user friendly and simple to use classes and functions.

## Used libraries:
### Tkinter
The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, including macOS, as well as on Windows systems.
### SpeechRecognition
Recognizing speech needs some input in the form of audio, and the SpeechRecognition package retrieves these kinds of input effortlessly. It needs no hardcore scripts to access microphones and then process the audio from scratch. Another advantage of this package is that it will save your time and in few minutes it can execute the instructions.The SpeechRecognition library behaves like a cover or a wrapper for various APIs solely built for speech. It is tremendously flexible and agile. One such API is the Google Web Speech API that supports hard-coded default speech recognition.
### PyAudio
PyAudio provides Python bindings for PortAudio v19, the cross-platform audio I/O library. With PyAudio, you can easily use Python to play and record audio on a variety of platforms, such as GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Apple macOS.
### pygame
pygame is a free and open-source cross-platform library for the development of multimedia applications like video games using Python. It uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer library and several other popular libraries to abstract the most common functions, making writing these programs a more intuitive task.
### pytest
The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.
